# NAIR
Code backup for nair.
Requires Monogame 3.8(?)
Not the version I made the game in, but it's the version I've used most recently.

To run the game you need to copy all the .cfg files from the base folder and put them in the folder you build in (bin/debug/etc). These control the default settings, and controller customization settings.
Without Config.cfg, the game will make a new one. Without any of the ControlProfile#.cfg, the game will not run.

This is NOT the Steam version of the game. (https://store.steampowered.com/app/1715850/NAIR)
This is release 1.2.0.




This branch includes some attempt at implementing rollback. It's unfinished, as I eventually switched to a different game engine. This implementation doesn't really reflect the final one, which both works and is formatted significantly better.
